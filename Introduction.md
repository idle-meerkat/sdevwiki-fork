This site is part of our native support for hardware switches through Linux Kernel. 
The current PP SDK has been created at the Linux user-space level. Note that interrupts, packets and configuration are handled without the Linux kernel. While this approach has its advantages – its main drawback is that is does not support the use of standard Linux routines using official (or partly official) Linux OS to provide PP functionality.
To ease the integration of PP drivers into the Linux Kernel, an infrastructure was built into the Kernel called switchDev – this layer, along with Linux NetDev modules, acts a basis for interaction between the upper Linux modules and the underlying PP driver that implements the switchDev / Netdev operations & notify them of various hardware events.
The following figure shows the different layers involved in these two methods:
