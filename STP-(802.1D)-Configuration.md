To enable STP on a bridge by run the following command:  
`$ ip link set dev br0 type bridge stp_state 1`  
By default, STP is disabled.  
To disable STP on the bridge set `stp_state` to “0”. 
To show the current `stp_state` value, run the following command can be used:  
`$ ip -d link show dev br0 | grep stp_state`    
In addition, to show extended STP configuration on the bridge (bridge stp state, port stp state, …), you can use `brctl` utility.  
`$ brctl showstp br0`  
You can use `brctl` to configure the following spanning tree protocol parameters:   
* Bridge priority
* Path priority and cost
* Forwarding delay
* Hello time
* Max age  
For an explanation of these parameters, see the IEEE 802.1d specification.
See [brctl man](https://linux.die.net/man/8/brctl) for details on bridge stp configurations.

3.2	RSTP (802.1w) configuration
To support RSTP it requires user level daemon mstpd which should be run in RSTP mode. The mstpd daemon is an open source project (https://github.com/mstpd/mstpd). 
The mstpctl utility provided by the mstpd service configures STP. 

After the bridge is created and STP is enabled (described above) additional configuration step needed to switch from STP to RSTP mode.

Switch the bridge mode from stp to rstp using the mstpctl application: 

To show information about the bridge:

To show port information:
