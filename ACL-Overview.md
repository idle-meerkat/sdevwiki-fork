Access Control Lists (ACL) enable you to apply policies on traffic flows by setting matching criteria (for example, 5-tuple) and actions (for example, pass/drop). The ACL can be used to restrict traffic forwarding, limit traffic rate, maintain statistics and trigger network address translation. ACL rules can be added/removed at any time and can apply to traffic ingresses and/or egresses, at the port level.
