To configure stateless Network Address Translation (NAT), use the `tc` iproute2 tool, the `tc-nat` action. The action is used in combination with the `flower` filter rule and ingress qdisc to do static NAT entry offloading.
The command format looks like the following: 
tc â€¦ flower ... action nat { ingress | egress } <OLD> <NEW> 
where, 
<OLD>   is the IP address which should be translated. 
<NEW>         is the IP address which IP should be translated into. 
ingress         translate destination addresses, i.e. perform DNAT. 
egress         translate source addresses, i.e. perform SNAT. 

To make NAT one-to-one mapping, you must configure one rule for private-to-public direction, and another rule for public-to-private direction. For more information on `tc-nat` action, see the official man page at [[https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-nat.8.html]]. 

# Basic example 
Create static one-to-one mapping from private (sw1p2) to public (sw1p1) subnet for all TCP traffic.  The IP 192.168.0.0/24 is the private subnet. 
The following figure shows Static NAT Setup:

First, you must define IP addresses on public/private host interfaces connected to the switch: 
```
# private host IP / default gateway 
ip addr add dev eth0 192.168.0.2/24 
ip route add default via 192.168.0.1 

# public host IP address (WAN port) 
ip addr add dev eth0 10.1.1.2/24 
```
Next, configure IP addresses on the switch public/private ports: 

```
ip addr add dev sw1p2 192.168.0.1/24 
ip addr add dev sw1p1 91.245.77.1/24 
```
Add a default gateway on the switch, to route packets via public interface. 

```
# add default gateway via public interface 
ip route add default via 91.245.77.1 
```
Configure ACL rules on switch to do NAT offloading: 

```
# public ports  
tc qdisc add dev sw1p1 clsact 
tc filter add dev sw1p1 protocol ip egress \ 
   flower ip_proto tcp src_ip 192.168.0.2 \ 
   action nat egress 192.168.0.2 91.245.77.1 

tc filter add dev sw1p1 protocol ip ingress \ 
   flower ip_proto tcp dst_ip 91.245.77.1 \ 
   action nat ingress 91.245.77.1 192.168.0.2 

# private ports, create only HW rule 
tc qdisc add dev sw1p2 clsact 
tc filter add dev sw1p2 protocol ip ingress \ 
   flower skip_sw ip_proto tcp src_ip 192.168.0.2 \ 
   action nat egress 192.168.0.2 91.245.77.1 
```
NOTE: The configuration is slightly different from usual Linux software configuration of stateless TC NAT, where NAT rules are applied on a public port only (e.g., WAN port). For instance: 
```
# public network 
tc qdisc add dev eth0 ingress 
tc filter add dev eth0 ingress protocol ip matchall \ 
   action nat ingress 172.31.19.2/32 10.0.2.2/32 
 
# private network 
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: prio 
tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1: protocol ip matchall \ 
   action nat egress 10.0.2.2/32 172.31.19.2/32 
```

Since the Switchdev driver egress qdisc (egress ACL) is not supported now by Switchdev driver, the public/private Switchdev TC NAT configuration is done by using ingress qdisc only which requires addition HW rules on private switch port.
