In most cases, the configuration of a portâ€™s parameters can be done using `ip`, `ifconfig`, `ifup2`, `ifdown2`, `ifquery` or `ethtool` linux commands. The detailed command description and usage examples are provided in this section.  
# Port Identification   
In order to specify the corresponding switch port name in Linux, use the following udev rule. It sets the interface name in the kernel driver, based on kernel port properties, such as switch ID and port ID.  
`SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTR{phys_switch_id}=="00", ATTR{phys_port_name}!="", NAME="sw0p$attr{phys_port_name}"`  

# Port State  
The port administrative status can be set using one of the following commands:
```
ip link set sw1p1 [up | down]
ifconfig sw1p1 [up | down]
ifup2 sw1p1
ifdown2 sw1p1
```
# Port MTU  
The port MTU can be set using one of the following commands:  
`ip link set dev sw1p1 mtu 1500`  
**NOTE** The driver supports maximum 3 different MTU settings.

# Port MAC Address  
The port MAC address can be set using one of the following commands:  
ip link set dev sw1p1 address 00:00:00:00:00:02  

# Port Speed
The port speed can be set using following commands (The value of speed should be in Mb/s.):  
`ethtool -s sw1p1 speed 1000`   
**NOTE:** The speed can only be set if autoneg is disabled. If you pass speed parameter when autoneg is enabled, it will be ignored.  

# Port Duplex Mode
The port duplex mode can be set using following commands:
`ethtool -s sw1p1 duplex [half|full]`  
**NOTE**: duplex can only be set if autoneg is disabled. If you pass duplex parameter when autoneg is enabled, it is ignored.
